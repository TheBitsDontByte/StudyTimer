A simple timer program written using JavaFX to track my hourly progress studying. 

Timer tracks the amount of time spent studying per day and records the number of days that have been tracked. 

Timer data is kept in two files, one which logs the time per day and one which keeps track of the current total time.

In the program the user is able to start the timer, pause the timer, reset the current time and close the program.
